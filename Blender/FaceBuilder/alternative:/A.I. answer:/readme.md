>Free alternatives to Blender's FaceBuilder for creating 3D faces include Facegen Modeller, MakeHuman, and the workflow using an iPhone's depth camera to create a MetaHuman. Other options are Daz 3D (and its tools), or using a free service like DeepMotion to generate a face from photos and then import it into Blender. 
># Software-Based Alternatives
>## Facegen Modeller:
>This tool can generate a 3D head model from two-dimensional images.
